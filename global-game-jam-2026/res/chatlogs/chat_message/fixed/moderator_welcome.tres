The internet is really a weird place, isn't it? Some of these things are things you'd never even think to say to other people, but when you're behind an account, people get a lot bolder...

See one of the mod reports I sent you for example. Nobody in real life would get that pressed over someone just saying hi, but when you have a digital mask everything goes, I guess.

(Get 80% or higher Atmosphere and 500 or more members on day 15 to win!)"
