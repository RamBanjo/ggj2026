im very passionate about anna. she's cute, playful, and spreads joy everwhere she goes. she's someone i aspire to be like. an idol, if you will. i made a bad joke that someone else took offense to, so i'll own up to that.

when i use an anna profile picture, i am representing her fans. the next time i post, i need to think how her fandom as a whole would look if i post what i plan to."
